# GLFW .AND. Cairo

Just a test how to use [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/).

This page contains examples on basic concepts of GLFW and Cairo. We encourage you to try these examples on your own before looking at the solution. Obviously, this project includes just the basics about programming in C using GLFW and Cairo. Also, for sure many things can be improved in it.
